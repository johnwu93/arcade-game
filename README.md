Frogger Arcade Game
===============================

This is a clone of the classical Frogger arcade game. In this game, the player needs to cross from
the grassy south side to the north river side. The player needs to avoid contact the bugs to cross
to the other side. Each time the player reaches to the other side, the player is sent back to the
spot that he spawned and earns a point. See how many points you can get. You only have 4 shots to
do so.
